# Mood

This is the example application created by following along with [Build an AI-Powered Fullstack Next.js App, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-app-next-v3/) on *Frontend Masters* by Scott Moss.

It's a Next.js application that uses Clerk for authentication.

## Getting Started

npm install
```

Create an account and new application at [Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

Copy `.env.example` as `.env.local`.

Enter your public and secret key from your application dashboard page at Clerk.

npm run dev
```
